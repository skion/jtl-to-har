jtl-to-har
==========

Simple JMeter (JTL) to HTTP Archive Format (HAR) translator.

This demo converts a JMeter .jtl output file to a corresponding .har object.
For optimal results, configure JMeter to include HTTP headers, cookies and
response bodies in its output.

Usage
-----

```php
$jtl = new JtlToHar($file or $string or $xmlobj);
$har = $jtl->convert();
print_r($har);
```

Upload the converted JSON object to Jan Odvarko's HAR viewer to see the result:
